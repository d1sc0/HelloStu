![Stuart Mackenzie](/images/hellostu.jpg){.left} I live in [Dorset](https://www.visit-dorset.com/) along with my wife Chloe, daughter Robyn and [four-legged friend Monty](https://www.instagram.com/m0nty_d0g/). I now spend much of my time working out of London transforming public services as an Executive Director at [FutureGov](https://wearefuturegov.com/).

I've worked in a variety of technology & management roles over the last 20 years but largely I prefer people to computers and code. I'm slightly obsessed (in a healthy way) in making change happen within organisations and I'm happiest when supporting teams and clients navigate complexity (human and technical) to deliver better outcomes for users.

This website is largely a selfish endevaour. I don't write often but it's a skill I know I should practice. Having the site gives me a place to do just that. Often I write just as a method to bring structure to the things I have floating around in my head. For this reason I inevitably write more posts than I publish. Hopefully the few that make it as far as publication might be useful to someone other than me but that's not my primary goal.

Having a website also provides me a sandbox to test ideas and prototype in code. If things feel a little broken or don't work as you expect then this might be as a result of one of these experiments.

I'm always open to making new connections with people. My social profiles are included at the top of this page if you want to get in touch or just be nosey but I've also provided a good old-fashioned [contact form](https://hellostuxyzmaster.gatsbyjs.io/contact) if that's more your thing!

For those interested in technology the site in it's current form has been built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) which is a simple static site generator. I've hooked this up to [Forestry](https://app.forestry.io/) to edit my markdown posts on the fly and out in the cloud. I use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting. All of the code, content and CI/CD is maintained/managed using [Github](https://github.com/d1sc0/hello-stu).
